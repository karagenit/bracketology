    <p>Since 2004 the Carmel High School AP Statistics classes have collected data on the NCAA Menâ€™s March Madness basketball tournament. The goal has been to identify the impact different variables have on the ability to successfully pick tournament games such as basketball knowledge, age and gender.</p>

    <p>This data will be analyzed by students in AP Stats as a review assignment in preparation for their AP Exam. Please take a few minutes to submit your bracket by selecting the link above. You may view updated standings as the tournament progresses.</p>
